# brlewis Advent of Code

I haven't done Advent of Code since
[2020](https://github.com/brlewis/adventofcode2020/tree/main), but having just
set up
[my emacs config](https://gitlab.com/brlewis/brlewis-config/-/blob/master/emacs/startup.el?ref_type=heads)
for deno, I thought this would be a good way to take it for a test drive.

What I find really cool is that you can run my code without trusting me. Just
run `deno test`, just like that, no options to grant any permissions. It's all
sandboxed.

Almost as cool, is the minimal configuration. The `deno.json` here is much
smaller than `package.json` in my 2020 repo.

I don't know how many days I'll actually do, since I also have a lot of real
work, but I've enjoyed the days I've solved so far.
